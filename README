# Nvidia Holoscan Sensor Interface Board
This repository contains the design files for a **sensor interface board** based on NVIDIA's Holoscan IP. The board is capable of connecting up to **two MIPI camera sensors**, handling data at a rate of 6 Gbps per channel. This data is then transmitted upstream via a **10 Gigabit Ethernet interface**.

The hardware and FPGA designs for this project are included in this repository.
